    Program to calculate the 'best' sequence of shipments for
    transports in Hades' Star using a bastardized version of
    the minmax algorithm. We assume that:

     o  A Transport Ship will load as many shipments as possible
        for the next planet in a calculated route.
     o  No cargo can be stored on any planet.
     o  The distance between any two planets is provided.
     o  No new shipments on any planets.

    Weighting is done by using:

      score = k_g * creditsGained - k_c * hydrogenCost
